# Tavily Search MCP Server

This project is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for the **Tavily AI Search Engine**. It acts as a bridge between a Large Language Model (LLM) or AI agent and the Tavily API, providing a set of clear, atomic tools for performing advanced web searches.

The server is built with Python and Flask, following the development philosophy outlined in the Klavis AI contributor guidelines.

## üìú Features & Available Tools

This server exposes the core functionality of the Tavily API through four distinct, atomic tools:

* **`search`**: Performs a standard, fast search. Ideal for general-purpose queries, fact-checking, or finding information on recent events.
* **`deep_search`**: Conducts a more comprehensive, in-depth search that is slower but returns more thorough results. This is best suited for research tasks or complex topics that require detailed information.
* **`get_direct_answer`**: Searches for and returns a direct, conversational answer to a specific question. This tool is most effective when the user asks a direct question (e.g., "What is the capital of France?").
* **`search_specific_domains`**: Restricts a search to a predefined list of websites. This is useful for finding information within trusted or specific sources (e.g., searching only on `wikipedia.org` and `reuters.com`).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the server running on your local machine.
